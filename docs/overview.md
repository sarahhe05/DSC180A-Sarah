# Project Overview

_Use this page to orient readers to the data science project itself. Replace the placeholder prompts with real content as your work progresses._

## Executive Summary

- **Problem statement**: What business/research question are you answering?
- **Stakeholders**: Who will consume the insights/models?
- **Success metrics**: Define quantitative or qualitative measures of success.
- **Timeline**: Current phase, major milestones, expected delivery dates.

## Objectives & Scope

- Primary objectives (bulleted list).
- Out-of-scope considerations or known exclusions.
- Assumptions and constraints (data availability, compute limits, compliance).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data acquisition** – summary of data sources to be ingested (see “Data & Experimentation”).
2. **Exploration & analysis** – notebooks, hypothesis generation.
3. **Feature engineering & modelling** – pipelines covered in “Modeling Strategy”.
4. **Evaluation & results** – reporting cadence and stakeholders (see “Results & Reporting”).
5. **Deployment or delivery** – how the findings/models will be consumed.

## Repository Highlights

- [`README.md`](../README.md) – quickstart commands and developer workflow.
- [`scripts/run_pipeline.py`](../scripts/run_pipeline.py) – example training pipeline (supports `--demo`).
- [`tests/unit/`](../tests/unit) – unit tests demonstrating expected behaviour.
- [`docs/`](./) – these documentation pages; publish via GitHub Pages.

## How to Contribute

- Update this page whenever objectives, scope, or milestones shift.
- Link to deeper documentation (e.g., dedicated experiment logs, dashboards, presentations).
- Use consistent headings across sections so teammates can quickly find information.
