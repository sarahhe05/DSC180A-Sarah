# Modeling Strategy

_Document methodologies, experiments, and key decisions related to modelling. Replace placeholders with actual project information as it becomes available._

## Problem Framing

- **Prediction target**: describe the response variable or classification objective.
- **Business KPIs**: connect model performance to business impact.
- **Constraints**: latency, interpretability requirements, fairness considerations.

## Baseline Model

- Summarise the baseline approach (e.g., linear regression, simple classifier).
- Provide a short code snippet or reference to the implementation (`train_linear_model`).
- Capture baseline metrics and why they serve as a starting point.

## Feature Engineering

- List primary features and their derivations.
- Note encodings, scaling, interactions, or domain-specific transformations.
- Mention tools or libraries used (pandas, sklearn, featuretools, etc.).

## Experiment Tracking

| Experiment ID | Description | Model/Params | CV/Validation Scheme | Metrics | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXP-001 | Baseline linear regression | Normal equation | Train/test split | RMSE = ... | Baseline |
| EXP-002 | Random Forest | n_estimators=200 | 5-fold CV | RMSE = ... | Improvement |

Update this table as new experiments are run. Link to notebooks, config files, or pipeline runs.

## Evaluation Strategy

- Validation approach (train/validation split, cross-validation, rolling windows).
- Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, accuracy, precision/recall, F1, ROC-AUC).
- Thresholds for success and decisions for model selection.

## Advanced Techniques (Optional)

- Hyperparameter tuning methodologies (GridSearch, Bayesian optimisation, Optuna).
- Ensembling or stacking strategies.
- Model explainability (SHAP, LIME, feature importance).
- Fairness checks or bias mitigation steps.

## Deployment Considerations

- How the model will be served (batch scoring, API endpoints, embedded in Product tool).
- Monitoring requirements (data drift, performance regression).
- Rollback plans or champion/challenger setups.
